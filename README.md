# MachineLearning
The project shows the solutions to the famous Coursera Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng. This commit displays week one to week five as well as an implementation of the kMeans - clustering algorithm. The solutions are implemented using Numpy, Pandas, scipy, matplotlib. In addition, minor data analysis was run on the famous California Housing dataset. You can run the script by either calling the main.py file and the whole script's executes or call concepts like Regularized Logistic  Regression independently using the TestUnit.py file. <br>
